# Crazyswarm
A Large Nano-Quadcopter Swarm.

The documentation is available here: http://crazyswarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

## Troubleshooting
Please start a [Discussion](https://github.com/USC-ACTLab/crazyswarm/discussions) for...

- Getting Crazyswarm to work with your hardware setup.
- Advice on how to use the [Crazyswarm Python API](https://crazyswarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) to achieve your goals.
- Rough ideas for a new feature.

Please open an [Issue](https://github.com/USC-ACTLab/crazyswarm/issues) if you believe that fixing your problem will involve a **change in the Crazyswarm source code**, rather than your own configuration files. For example...

- Bug reports.
- New feature proposals with details.
