"""Test video output in simulation.

This test is a bit strange: due to the following conditions

- Video capture runs until the script process stops,
- Video capture uses a child ffmpeg process to do compression,
- We register an `atexit` function to ensure that the pipe is flushed and
  ffmpeg process is closed cleanly,

we must run the video-generating script in a separate process.

Using `multiprocessing` would be easier, but `multiprocessing` processes don't
run `atexit` handlers when they exit. This design is controversial [1, 2].
Therefore, we must do a full `system()`-style process spawn with `subprocess`
instead. To avoid adding another script just to support this test, this script
will behave as the video generator process when run as `__main__()`, and behave
as the test process when run via pytest.
