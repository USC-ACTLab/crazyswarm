Welcome to Crazyswarm's documentation!
======================================

The Crazyswarm projects allows you to fly a swarm of quadcopters (using Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.0 directly or as control boards)
in tight, synchronized formations.
A motion capture system is recommended (VICON, OptiTrack, Qualisy are supported). We successfully flew 49
Crazyflies using three Crazyradios. An example video for what you can do is shown below:

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

    </div>


The Crazyswarm architecture, including some motivation for the design decisions, is described in
`our paper <http://usc-actlab.github.io/publications/Preiss_ICRA2017.pdf>`_ [pdf].

A talk at the `Aerial Swarms Workshop <https://lis2.epfl.ch/iros2019swarms/index.html>`_ at IROS 2019 includes a primer on how to use the Crazyswarm and a bibliography of papers using the Crazyswarm: `Slides <https://drive.google.com/file/d/15favAyrLLpC_O6nrAp-eIbZijFUMLgwV/view?usp=sharing>`_ [pdf].
