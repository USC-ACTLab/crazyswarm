Configuration
=============

After completing :ref:`installation`,
a significant amount of configuration is needed before the Crazyswarm is ready to fly.
Follow the steps below.

Prepare Crazyflies
------------------

Since the Crazyflies are sharing radios and communication channels, they need to have a unique identifier/address.
The convention in the Crazyswarm is to use the following address::

    0xE7E7E7E7<X>

where ``<X>`` is the number of the Crazyflie in the hexadecimal system. For example cf1 will use address ``0xE7E7E7E701`` and cf10 uses address ``0xE7E7E7E70A``.
The easiest way to assign addresses is to use the official Crazyflie Python Client.

1. Label your Crazyflies with numbers.
2. Assign addresses using the Crazyflie Python Client (use a USB cable for easiest handling).
3. Each radio can control about 15 Crazyflies. If you have more than 15 CFs you will need to assign different channels to the Crazyflies. For example, if you have 49 Crazyflies you'll need three unique channels. It is up to you which channels you assign to which CF, but a good way is to use the Crazyflie number modulo the number of channels. For example, cf1 is assigned to channel 80, cf2 is assigned to channel 90, cf3 is assigned to channel 100, cf4 is assigned to channel 80 and so on.
4. Upgrade the firmwares of your Crazyflies with the provided firmwares (both NRF51 and STM32 firmwares).

  - Option 1: Upload the firmware via the command line using ``make cload`` as described `here <https://wiki.bitcraze.io/doc:crazyflie:dev:starting>`_ instead of using Bitcraze graphical app.
  - Option 2: Upload the precompiled firmware by executing the following steps:

      #. Plug in a battery
      #. Turn your Crazyflie off by pressing the on/off button
      #. Set your Crazyflie into bootloader mode by holding the on/off button for 3 seconds (The blue M2 and M3 LEDs start to blink)
      #. ``rosrun crazyflie_tools flash --target nrf51 --filename prebuilt/cf2_nrf.bin``
      #. Turn your Crazyflie off by pressing the on/off button
      #. Set your Crazyflie into bootloader mode by holding the on/off button for 3 seconds (The blue M2 and M3 LEDs start to blink)
      #. ``rosrun crazyflie_tools flash --target stm32 --filename prebuilt/cf2.bin``

5. Upgrade the firmware of your Crazyradios with the provided firmware.

  - Option 1: follow the instructions in the ``crazyradio-firmware`` folder to install the self-compiled version.
  - Option 2: Use the prebuilt binary:

      #. ``python crazyradio-firmware/usbtools/launchBootloader.py``
      #. ``sudo python crazyradio-firmware/usbtools/nrfbootload.py flash prebuilt/cradio.bin``
      #. Now unplug and re-plug the radio. You can check the version using ``rosrun crazyflie_tools scan -v``, which should report ``Found Crazyradio with version 99.55``.

  - Note: Your Crazyflie needs to be rebooted after any change of the channel/address for the changes to take any effect.

6. Set up PC permissions to use the USB Radio without being root.

  - Option 1: follow the instructions in the ``crazyflie-lib-python`` folder or look at `here <https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-lib-python#platform-notes>`_.
  - Option 2: Use the script: ``./pc_permissions.sh``



Adjust configuration files
--------------------------

Several configuration files may require editing.
The most significant configuration choice is whether or not to use *unique arrangements*
of motion capture markers for each Crazyflie in your fleet.
Select one of the tabs below for a description of each choice.
Later steps in the documentation will change depending on your selection.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Unique Marker Arrangements

      With a unique marker arrangement for each Crazyflie, you rely on the motion capture hardware to differentiate between objects.
      This is generally preferred.
      However, if you have lots of Crazyflies, it can be hard to design enough unique configurations -- there are not many places to put a marker on the Crazyflie.

      If your arrangements are too similar, motion capture software may not fail gracefully.
      For example, it may rapidly switch back and forth between recognizing two different objects at a single physical location.

   .. group-tab:: Duplicated Marker Arrangements

      If more than one Crazyflie has the same marker arrangement, standard motion capture software will refuse to track them.
      Instead, Crazyswarm can use the raw point cloud from the motion capture system and track the CFs frame-by-frame.
      There are two main consequences of this option:

      - The initial positions of the Crazyflies must be known, to establish a mapping between radio IDs and physical locations.
      - The tracking is done frame-by-frame, so if markers are occluded for a significant amount of time,
        the algorithm may not be able to re-establish the ID-location mapping once they are visible again.

      You can use more than one marker arrangement in this mode.
      For example, you might have several standard Crazyflies with arrangement 1,
      and several larger quadcopters with arrangement 2.


.. _config_crazyflies_yaml:

Enumerate Crazyflies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First we have ``crazyflies.yaml``, a file that lists all active Crazyflies.
The Crazyswarm server reads this configuration file at startup.
If it cannot communicate with all the Crazyflies defined in ``crazyflies.yaml``, it will halt and report an error.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # ros_ws/src/crazyswarm/launch/crazyflies.yaml
    crazyflies:
      - id: 1
        channel: 100
        initialPosition: [1.5, 1.5, 0.0]
        type: default
      - id: 2
        channel: 110
        initialPosition: [1.5, 1.0, 0.0]
        type: medium

The file assumes that the address of each CF is set as discussed earlier.
The channel can be freely configured.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Unique Marker Arrangements

      If you use unique marker arrangements, the ``initialPosition`` field of the ``crazyflies.yaml`` entries will be ignored,
      but it should still be set because the parser will expect it.

   .. group-tab:: Duplicated Marker Arrangements

      If you use duplicated marker arrangements, ``initialPosition`` must be correct.
      Positions are specified in meters, in the coordinate system of your motion capture device.
      It is not required that the CFs start exactly at those positions -- a few centimeters variation is fine.

It is often useful to select a subset of all available Crazyflies.
The graphical "Chooser" and the additional configuration file ``allCrazyflies.yaml`` help make this easy.
See :ref:`config_chooser` for details.


.. _config_types:


Define Crazyflie types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second configuration file ``crazyflieTypes.yaml`` defines the possible *types*.
Each type specifies the physical attributes of the quadrotor.
The ``type`` field in the ``crazyflies.yaml`` entries must refer to a type listed in this file.

.. note::

   Many users will not need to modify this file.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # ros_ws/src/crazyswarm/launch/crazyflieTypes.yaml
    crazyflieTypes:
      default:
        bigQuad: False
        batteryVoltageWarning: 3.8  # V
        batteryVoltateCritical: 3.7 # V
        markerConfiguration: 0
        dynamicsConfiguration: 0
        firmwareParams:
          ...
      medium:
        bigQuad: True
        batteryVoltageWarning: 7.6  # V
        batteryVoltateCritical: 7.4 # V
        markerConfiguration: 1
        dynamicsConfiguration: 0
        firmwareParams:
          ...
    numMarkerConfigurations: 2
    markerConfigurations:
      "0":  # for standard Crazyflie
        numPoints: 4
        offset: [0.0, -0.01, -0.04]
        points:
          "0": [0.0177184,0.0139654,0.0557585]
          "1": [-0.0262914,0.0509139,0.0402475]
          "2": [-0.0328889,-0.02757,0.0390601]
          "3": [0.0431307,-0.0331216,0.0388839]
      "1": # medium frame
        numPoints: 4
        offset: [0.0, 0.0, -0.03]
        points:
          "0": [-0.00896228,-0.000716753,0.0716129]
          "1": [-0.0156318,0.0997402,0.0508162]
          "2": [0.0461693,-0.0881012,0.0380672]
          "3": [-0.0789959,-0.0269793,0.0461144]
    numDynamicsConfigurations: 1
    dynamicsConfigurations:
      "0":
        maxXVelocity: 2.0
        maxYVelocity: 2.0
        maxZVelocity: 3.0
        maxPitchRate: 20.0
        maxRollRate: 20.0
        maxYawRate: 10.0
        maxRoll: 1.4
        maxPitch: 1.4
        maxFitnessScore: 0.001



.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Unique Marker Arrangements

      The ``markerConfiguration`` fields are not needed with unique marker arrangements.
      All marker setup should be done in your motion capture system.
      Create one object in your motion capture software for each marker arrangement
      and give them names like ``cf1``, ``cf2``, ``cf3``, etc., corresponding to the IDs listed in your ``crazyflies.yaml``.

   .. group-tab:: Duplicated Marker Arrangements

      For duplicated marker arrangements, each arrangement must be described by a ``markerConfigurations`` entry.
      The ``points`` specify the physical arrangement of markers you use, in the motion capture coordinate system.
      For example, the marker configuration ``"0"`` corresponds to an off-the-shelf Crazyflie with the marker configuration shown below:

      .. figure:: images/markerConfigurationExample.jpg
         :align: center
         :scale: 70%

      To get values for the ``points``, follow these steps:

      #. Place one CF with the desired arrangement at the origin of your motion capture space. The front of the Crazyflie should point in the ``x`` direction of the motion capture coordinate system.
      #. Find the coordinates of the used markers, for example by using ``roslaunch crazyswarm mocap_helper.launch``. (You may need to do ``source ros_ws/devel/setup.bash`` before ``roslaunch``)
      #. Update ``crazyflieTypes.yaml``.


Configure motion capture system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The third configuration file is the ROS launch file, ``ros_ws/src/crazyswarm/launch/hover_swarm.launch``.
It contains settings on which motion capture system to use, among others.

Select hardware make
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, select your motion capture hardware.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # ros_ws/src/crazyswarm/launch/hover_swarm.launch
    motion_capture_type: "vicon" # one of vicon,optitrack,qualisys,none

Next, select the appropriate tab below and perform the manufacturer-specific configuration.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Vicon

      Vicon is fully supported and tested with Tracker 3.4.
      Set the host name of the Vicon machine:

      .. code-block:: yaml

          # ros_ws/src/crazyswarm/launch/hover_swarm.launch
          vicon_host_name: "vicon" # only needed if vicon is selected

   .. tab:: OptiTrack

      Select your local and server IPs:

      .. code-block:: yaml

          # ros_ws/src/crazyswarm/launch/hover_swarm.launch
          optitrack_local_ip: "localhost" # only needed if optitrack is selected
          optitrack_server_ip: "optitrack" # only needed if optitrack is selected

      Use the following settings for correct operation:

        * Un-tick the rigid body in Motive so that the point cloud is streamed.
        * Advanced network settings. Up axis: Z
        * When specifying the marker locations in the config file you need to use the coordinates in Rviz and not Motive.

      Instruction on how to use the rigid body option with Optitrack are available `here <https://github.com/USC-ACTLab/libmotioncapture/pull/3>`_.

   .. tab:: Qualisys

      Qualisys has been tested to work with QTM 2.16 both for rigid body and point cloud. It is expected to work with any later version of QTM.
      Set the host name and port of the Qualisys machine:

      .. code-block:: yaml

          # ros_ws/src/crazyswarm/launch/hover_swarm.launch
          qualisys_host_name: "10.0.5.219" # only needed if qualisys is selected
          qualisys_base_port: 22222 # only needed if qualisys is selected

      If using ``motionCapture`` as ``object_tracking_type`` make sure to check the checkbox ``Calculate 6DOF`` in QTM ``Project options/Processing/Real time actions``.

      If using ``libobjecttracker`` as ``object_tracking_type`` and you have setup 6DOF tracking for your Crazyflies in QTM, make sure to disable the ``Calculate 6DOF`` checkbox.


   .. tab:: None

      The usage of a motion capture system can be disabled by selecting ``none``.
      This is useful for on-board solutions such as the Ultra-Wideband localization system (UWB), LightHouse, or dead-reckoning using the flow-deck.


.. _config_objecttracking:

Select object tracking mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, select the object tracking type:


.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Unique Marker Arrangements

      .. code-block:: yaml

          # ros_ws/src/crazyswarm/launch/hover_swarm.launch
          object_tracking_type: "motionCapture"

      Set ``object_tracking_type`` to ``"motionCapture"``.

   .. group-tab:: Duplicated Marker Arrangements
      j
      .. code-block:: yaml

          # ros_ws/src/crazyswarm/launch/hover_swarm.launch
          object_tracking_type: "libobjecttracker"

      When using ``libobjecttracker`` it is important to disable tracking of Crazyflies in your motion capture system's control software.
      Some motion capture systems remove markers from the point cloud when they are matched to an object.
      Since ``libobjecttracker`` operates on the raw point cloud, it will not be able to track any Crazyflies that have already been "taken" by the motion capture system.


.. _config_chooser:

Manage fleet with the Chooser
-----------------------------

The graphical *Chooser* tool is used to enable/disable subsets of the available Crazyflies
and perform other practical tasks.
Chooser relies on the additional configuration file ``allCrazyflies.yaml``,
which has the same format as ``crazyflies.yaml`` (see :ref:`config_crazyflies_yaml`).
Edit this file to contain all the Crazyflies you have available.
Then, start the Chooser::

    cd ros_ws/src/crazyswarm/scripts
    python chooser.py

You should see something like the screenshot below.

.. image:: images/chooser.png

Each checkbox corresponds to an entry in ``allCrazyflies.yaml``.
The checkbox positions should match the ``initialPosition`` fields in the file.
You can drag a box to select many checkboxes at once.

Whenever the selection is changed,
the ``allCrazyflies.yaml`` entries for the selected boxes are **immediately** copied and written to ``crazyflies.yaml``.

.. note::

   If you are using the ``allCrazyflies.yaml`` and the Chooser,
   you should never need to edit ``crazyflies.yaml`` manually.

The buttons perform various functions that can be tedious to do for many CFs:

:Clear:   Deselects all CFs.
:Fill:    Selects all CFs.
:battery: Retrieves battery voltage for enabled CFs. Only works if ``crazyflie_server`` is not running at the same time. Can be used while the CF is in power-safe mode.
:version: Retrieves STM32 firmware version of enabled CFs. Only works if ``crazyflie_server`` is not running at the same time. Can only be used if CF is fully powered on.
:sysOff: Puts enabled CFs in power-safe mode (NRF51 powered, but STM32 turned off). Only works if ``crazyflie_server`` is not running at the same time.
:reboot: Reboot enabled CFs (such that NRF51 and STM32 will be powered). Only works if ``crazyflie_server`` is not running at the same time.
:flash (STM): Flashes STM32 firmware to enabled CFs. Only works if ``crazyflie_server`` is not running at the same time. Assumes that firmware is built.
:flash (NRF): Flashes NRF51 firmware to enabled CFs. Only works if ``crazyflie_server`` is not running at the same time. Assumes that firmware is built.


Testing configuration
---------------------

Once you have finished configuration,
move on to the :ref:`tutorial_hover` tutorial for your first test flight!
